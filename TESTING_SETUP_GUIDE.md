## üîç Proxy Debug Headers & Diagnostics
 
 Use this section to troubleshoot odds proxy behavior from the frontend and backend.
 
 ### Enable lightweight proxy debug logging (backend)
 - Local run (temporary):
 ```bash
 LOG_PROXY_DEBUG=1 python3 server_multiuser.py
 ```
 - Render (production via blueprint): the service sets `LOG_PROXY_DEBUG=1` in `render.yaml`. You can also set it in the Render dashboard under Environment.
 
 ### Inspect headers in the browser
 1) Open `diag.html` on the frontend:
 - Local: `http://localhost:8000/diag.html` (or your local dev URL)
 - Production: `https://scoreleague.netlify.app/diag.html`
 
 2) Set API base if needed:
 - Use the "API Base Override" section to set `http://localhost:3001` for local API, or your deployed API URL.
 
 3) Click "Fetch Headers" beneath "Proxy Debug Headers". You should see for each endpoint:
 - `X-Proxy-Mode`: one of `cache`, `fallback-proxy`, `upstream`, `demo`, `upstream-empty`, `upstream-error`, `error`
 - `X-Cache-Key`: present when cache/upstream/fallback-proxy uses a cache key
 - `X-Upstream-Status`: present when an upstream HTTP error code is captured
 
 ### Verify via curl (CLI)
 ```bash
 # Sports list (expect headers exposed)
 curl -s -D - -o /dev/null "$API_BASE/api/odds/sports"
 
 # Sample odds request (soccer EPL) ‚Äî replace API_BASE as needed
 curl -s -D - -o /dev/null "$API_BASE/api/odds?sport=soccer_epl"
 ```
 Look for these response headers:
 - `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-Proxy-Mode, X-Cache-Key, X-Upstream-Status`
 - `X-Proxy-Mode: <mode>`
 - Optionally `X-Cache-Key` and `X-Upstream-Status` depending on mode
 
 ### Bypass proxy cache (optional)
 To force a fresh fetch and skip the server-side cache, both odds endpoints accept a `bypass_cache` query parameter. The value is treated as truthy when one of `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on` is used. This flag is also forwarded to the fallback proxy, ensuring cache bypass behavior is consistent end-to-end.
 
 ```bash
 # Sports list (skip cache)
 curl -s -D - -o /dev/null "$API_BASE/api/odds/sports?bypass_cache=1"
 
 # Sample odds request (skip cache)
 curl -s -D - -o /dev/null "$API_BASE/api/odds?sport=soccer_epl&bypass_cache=1"
 ```
 
 Notes:
 - `/api/odds/sports` responses include a fixed header `X-Cache-Key: sports_list` for consistency across modes (cache, upstream, fallback-proxy, demo).
 - The Diagnostics UI (`diag.html`) includes a "Bypass cache" checkbox in the "Proxy Debug Headers" section. When checked, it appends `bypass_cache=1` to the test requests so you can easily compare headers with and without cache.
